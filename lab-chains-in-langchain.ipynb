       "'Of course! The Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental principle in geometry that relates to right-angled triangles. It states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\\n\\nIn mathematical terms, if a and b are the lengths of the two shorter sides of a right triangle, and c is the length of the hypotenuse, then the Pythagorean theorem can be written as:\\n\\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\\n\\nThis theorem is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras, who is credited with its discovery. The Pythagorean theorem is not only important for solving problems in geometry, but it also has applications in various fields such as physics, engineering, and computer science.'"
